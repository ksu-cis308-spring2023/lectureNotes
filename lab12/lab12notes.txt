60 minutes, no lab activity.

//////////////////////////////////

Here are some sample questions:

1) Define a type called ARTIST
    - can be either painter or singer
    - keep name, age, #years worked
    - painters keep type of paint (watercolor, oil, acrylic) and
        style (realism, abstract, impressionist)
    - singer keeps voice range (bass, tenor, alto, soprano) and
        number of concerts performed

typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    int years;
    enum {isPainter, isSinger} artType;
    union {
        struct {
            enum {watercolor, oil, acrylic} paintType;
            enum {realism, abstract, impressionist} style;
        } paintStuff;
        struct {
            enum {bass, tenor, alto, soprano} voice;
            int concerts;
        } singStuff;
    } artStuff;
} ARTIST;




2) Create an array that can hold pointers to 10 different artists.
Dynamically create a particular artist, fill with values.
Free memory.

ARTIST** array = malloc(10*sizeof(ARTIST*));


//initalize index 2
//singer, "Bob Jones", 30, 5 yrs, bass, 2 concerts

array[2] = malloc(sizeof(ARTIST));
array[2]->age = 30;
strcpy(array[2]->name, "Bob Jones");
array[2]->artType = singer;
array[2]->years = 5;
array[2]->artStuff.singStuff.voice = bass;
array[2]->artStuff.singStuff.concerts = 2;


//free the memory

free(array[2]);
free(array);



3) Write a function that adds a new node to the end of a linked list.

typedef struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* next;
} NODE;


//return updated head
NODE* addToEnd(NODE* head, int newData) {
    NODE* cur = malloc(sizeof(NODE));
    cur->data = newData;
    cur->next = NULL;

    if (head == NULL) {
        return cur;
    }
    else {
        NODE* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = cur;
        return head;
    }
}

do the same thing with this function:

void addToEnd(NODE** head, int newData) {
    NODE* cur = malloc(sizeof(NODE));
    cur->data = newData;
    cur->next = NULL;

    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = cur;
    }
    else {
        NODE* temp = *head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = cur;
    }
}


elsewhere, if "front" was the address of our first node...

NODE* front ....


...how would we add "2" to the end using each function?


first function?

front = addToEnd(front, 2);


second function?

addToEnd(&front, 2);



/////////////////////////////////

Function pointers - pointers to executable code


/////

Declare:

    return_type (*ptr_name) (args);

ptr_name is the declared variable name, of type function pointer
    to a function that:
        - returns something of type return_type
        - takes parameters args


We MUST put () around (*ptr_name)
    ...or will interpret as declaring a REGULAR function
        returning return_type*

////

Initialize:

    ptr_name = someFunction;

    -OR-

    ptr_name = &someFunction;

Where someFunction has the specified return_type and args.

///////////////////////////////////

Example.

Suppose we have these functions:

int plus(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int minus(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

///

How could declare a function pointer called opptr to a function that
    returns an int and takes 2 int parameters:


int (*opptr) (int, int);


--> How could we initialize our new function pointer?

opptr = minus;


///////////////////////////////

Using a function pointer:

- want to go to that executable code, specify parameters,
    accept returned value



result = ptr_name(params);

-OR-

result = (*ptr_name)(params);


--> call function pointed to by opptr, pass 4 and 3.

int diff = opptr(4, 3);

/////////////////////////////

Function pointer parameters.

See opPtrs example.

Define doOperation function that takes a function pointer.

(describe C's qsort)

////////////////////////////

Typedef and function pointers.

--> listing syntax for function pointer type is messy

--> nicer to rename the type using typedef

Typedef syntax:

    typedef return_type (*NEW_TYPE) (args);

Now, NEW_TYPEe is a new type (of type function pointer to a function
    with the specified signature).


///////////

Example: Add typedef to create a new function pointer type name in
    operations example

Make doOperation parameter of that type instead

Create array of function pointers in main (using function pointer
    type name)

/////////////

Lab 12.

Similar idea.

Will define a function pointer to a pet filtering function
Will create 4 pet filter functions
Will use an array index to call appropriate function
