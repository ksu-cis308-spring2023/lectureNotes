step 1: read in the size on the first line (size)

int** sets = malloc(size*sizeof(int*));

i = 0
loop with fgets (while fgets...). line holds current row.
    use strtok on line, use " \n\r" as delimeters
        count the pieces

    sets[i] = malloc(count*sizeof(int));

    now use strtok again on line, same delims
        sets[i][j] = atoi(token)

    i++

Exam 1 is next week (Tues Feb 28)

///////////////////////////////

Closed notes, closed computers

60 minutes long (exam will be from 11:00 am - 12:00 pm). 
    You may leave after your finish -- there is no lab activity.

Exam will be all paper-based

//////////////////

Types of questions:
- Determine what is printed by a code fragment
- Write "code snippets" that are a few lines of code each
- Write a function following a specification
- Find errors in code

Topics covered:
- C basics (main function, #include statements, variables and operations, 
    conditional statements, loops, functions, printing [printf], 
    user input [scanf and fgets])

- Constant sized arrays (how to declare, where allocated, 
    restrictions, what kind of variable is one of these arrays)

- Strings (user input with fgets, how stored, strlen)

- Pointers (declaring, initializing, address-of operator, 
    dereferencing operator, pointer arithmetic, 
    pointer notation vs. array notation, pointers to pointers, 
    call-by-reference functions)

- Dynamic memory (malloc, free, where allocated, 
    constant-sized arrays vs. dynamic arrays, memory management, 
    allocating and freeing single-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, 
    sizeof function)

//////////////

Other potential topics (I will include necessary function prototypes if 
    I include these questions):

- File I/O (I would give you the fopen, fclose, fscanf, 
    and/or fgets prototypes as needed for the problems)

- Additional string functions (strcpy, strcat, strtok, strcmp, etc. 
    - I would give you the prototypes for these if you were expected to 
    use them)

- Additional dynamic memory functions (calloc, realloc - again, 
    I would provide these prototypes if you need to use them)

- Command-line arguments - I would give you the:

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) 

prototype if you were expected to use command-line arguments

/////////////////////////////

Review questions (doesn't cover all topics).

int nums[8];

1) Make int pointer called "ptr" hold the address of the 2nd element in nums

int* ptr = nums + 1; //&nums[1]

2) Use ptr to change the 3rd element in nums to be 11

*(ptr+1) = 11;  //ptr[1] = 11;



3) What do these do:

*nums = 7;
nums++;     //no! nums is a constant pointer


4) Can we do:

ptr[2] = 3; 


5) Make ptr point to val:

int val = 7;

ptr = &val;

6) Use ptr to change val to 10

*ptr = 10;


7) Using only pointer notation, put the contents of val (10)
in the last spot of nums

*(nums+7) = * ptr;


8) What would this do:

    ptr[1] = 7;



///////////////////////

Write a function that takes a string and two characters
Replace every instance of the first character with the second character

(without strlen, use pointer notation)


void replace(char* str, char one, char two) {
    char* temp = str;

    while (*temp != '\0') {
        if (*temp == one) {
            *temp = two;
        }
        temp++;
    }
}



//////////////////////

Write a code fragment that gets a word from user input,
calls your function to replace each 'a' with a '*', and prints the result


(try this)

/////////////////////

Dynamically allocate a 5x6 array of ints

int** grid = malloc(5*sizeof(int*));
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    grid[i] = malloc(6*sizeof(int));
}


Assume the array has been filled. Ask the user for a row
number. Use pointer notation to print the elements in that row.

row is our row number

int* temp = *(grid+row);
while (temp < *(grid+row) + 6) {
    printf("%d\n", *temp);
    temp++;
}



Free the memory.

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    free(grid[i]);
}
free(grid);


/////////////////////

GDB debugger (see list of commands in textbook)

Example 1: finding error in factorial program

Example 2: locating segmentation fault

Example 3: work with pointers

////////////////

Lab 6

using gdb debugger

if not installed, use lab machines

    (on lab machines, need to open separate instance
    of PowerShell or command prompt)

what should the lab do when it is finished?
