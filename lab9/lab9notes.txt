Project 3 due Wednesday, April 5

//////////////////////

typedef - allows renaming of types


typedef old_type new_type;




Example:

typedef char GRADE;


GRADE g = 'A';

///////////////////

typedef with structs

Old way:

struct person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
};

struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* next;
};


--> make types PERSON and NODE with typedef





/////////////////////////////////

Multiple files

- Can reuse (include) functions and types that are defined
    in a header file (.h) and implemented in a corresponding
    code file (.c)


- The .c file with your main function will NOT have a .h file


- Sometimes you might have a header file with just type definitions
    --> don't need a corresponding .c file in this case



- If you are referring to types / implementing functions /
    calling functions that are defined elsewhere, do:

    #include "name.h"


At the top of the file (will look in your working directory).





////////////////////////////////

Creating a header file

- Saved as .h



#ifndef NAME_H
#define NAME_H

//contents of file

//define types (structs, etc.)
//define function prototypes

#endif




////////////////////////

Implementing a .c file corresponding to a .h file:

#include "name.h"

//implement all the function prototypes from name.h




////////////////////////

Example: program that uses a stack and a linked list

types.h
    - define a node for holding int data in a linked structure


stack.h plus stack.c
    - define and implement stack (push/pop) with int data
    - similar to Lab 8


linkedlist.h plus linkedlist.c
    - define and implement add, printlist, releasemem for linked list
    - similar to last week's example


lab9example.c (contains main function)
    - push 1-10 onto stack, pop and print
    - add 1-4 to linked list, print list, release memory




///////////////////////

Building programs with multiple files

- need to separately compile each code file into an object file
- then link together object files into an executable

For each code (.c) file:

    gcc -c name.c

--> will produce object file name.o


Link all object files together:

    gcc name1.o name2.o (etc.)

Will produce executable a.exe (a.out)


--> try it on data structures example


//////////////////////////////

Makefiles

--> it is a pain to separate compile everything and link it together

--> Makefiles summarize build commands so you can do everything with:

make

--> can also specify how to "clean" project (remove .o, .exe files)


--> save under name "Makefile" (no extension)

--> need make.exe installed, available on path variable

///////////////////////

Makefile template (list headers, code, target name):

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -g -Wall
EXE = exename
HEADERS = (list all the .h files)
CODE = (list all the .c files)

OBJECTS = $(CODE:.c=.o)

target: $(OBJECTS) $(HEADERS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $(EXE)

clean:
    rm -f *.o *.exe *.out




/////////////////////

Example: Makefile for data structures example

Lab 9: sort an input file of words by length, using a queue
    --> assume all word lengths are < 30 letters


How does a queue work? How would we write enqueue?


types.h: defines WORD (a struct to wrap a string) and NODE 
    (a struct with WORD* data)


    typedef struct {
        char str[30];
    } WORD;

- queue.h - you write whole thing. ifndef block, prototypes
- queue.c - you write enqueue. similar to push (stack) and
    add (linked list)
- lab9.c - finish main function
    contains two size-30 arrays to help represent 30 queues
        head_length and tail_length
    head_length[2] is the NODE* head of the queue of words with length 2
    tail_length[2] is the NODE* tail of the queue of words with length 2



So if we have:

    typedef struct {
        char str[30];
    } WORD;

void enqueue(WORD* w, NODE** headptr, NODE** tailptr)


How would we enqueue "ball" in main?

--> where is the head and tail of the correct queue?

--> what do we need to create with "ball" first?
