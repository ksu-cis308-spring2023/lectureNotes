Project 1 due Wednesday, February 9

--> start now if you haven't already!

redaction idea


word list: the mammal is to


Original text:
The cheetah is the fastest land mammal. They run 60 mph.
The blue whale is the biggest mammal. They weigh up to 200 tons.

Redacted text:
The cheetah *** ** fastest land ***. They run 60 mph.
The blue whale *** *** biggest ***. They weigh up *** 200 tons.



////////////////////////////

Project 1 running instructions:

type input.txt | ./a.exe word1 word2 ... wordN > output.txt



Input and output is with CONSOLE, not a file
    - use fgets with stdin for input
        ...but it will come from input.txt

    - use printf (like usual) for output
        ...but it will go to output.txt


///////////////////////////////

Command-line arguments:

int main(int argc, char* argv[])




Suppose we run program like:

./a.exe one two

What is argc? What is argv[0]? What is argv[1]?

argc is 3
argv[0] is "a.exe"
argv[1] is "one"
argv[2] is "two"



////////////////

conversion to string (more in the textbook)

int age = 10;


char str[20];
sprintf(str, "%d", age);

--> what is in str? {'1', '0', '\0'}




--> can store other values in a string that way


//////////////////////////////

more string functions - #include <string.h>

- I won't mention all string functions here
- make sure you read textbook chapter on strings if you haven't already









////////////////////////////

Copying strings.

1) First attempt:

In C# we do:
    string s1 = "hi";
    string s2 = s1;

Can we do this in C?
    char s1[] = "hi";
    char s2[] = s1; 

NO! arrays are constant references. We can't make them reference
something else.


2) Second attempt:

    char[] strcpy(char str1[], char str2[]);

This function copies the characters in str2 into str1, 
overwriting anything that was already in str1. 
It returns the newly copied string (str1 also references the copied string).



For example:

char test[] = "hi";
char dest[20];


--> copy test into dest

strcpy(dest, test);
strcpy(dest, "foo"); <-- will overwrite what was there





--> can we copy into test?

strcpy(test, "ball"); <-- will write past end of array




//////////////////////////////

char[] strcat(char str1[], char str2[]);

Copies characters in str2 onto the end of str1.
Returns the newly concatenated string 
(although str1 also references the concatenated string).



For example:

char test[] = "hi";     //what characters?
char buff[10] = "ah";   //what characters?



--> concatenate test onto buff
	(what do both strings look like now?)

strcat(buff, test);





--> what if we have:

    char empty[10];

Can we concatenate onto empty?

empty[0] = '\0';
strcat(empty, "ball");



/////////////////////////////

char* strtok(char str[], char delim[]);

- Returns the first token found in str before the occurrence 
    of any character in delim. 

- After the first call to strtok, pass NULL as str
    to tell it to continue looking for tokens in the original string.

- If there are multiple delimeters in a row, it will skip all of them
    (like Java StringTokenizer)



For example:

char buff[200];
char *token;    //a char pointer - more later

printf("Enter names, separated by commas: ");
fgets(buff, 200, stdin);    //"Fred, James, Jane, Lynn"

buff[strcspn(buff, "\n")] = '\0';

token = strtok(buff, ", ");
while (token != NULL) 
{
	printf("%s\n", token);
	token = strtok(NULL, ", ");
}


--> What prints?




//////////////////////////////

File I/O

#include <stdio.h>



1) Connect to the file

FILE* conn_name = fopen(filename, mode);

- filename is a string (looks in same dir as .c file without abs. path)

- mode is "r" or "w" (plus other options - see text)

- returns NULL if file can't be opened





////////////////////////////////////


2) Read from the file

fgets(buff, size, conn_name)

--> just like fgets from stdin (reads one line at a time)

--> returns NULL if reaches end of input

--> stores the \n



char buff[30];
while (fgets(buff, size, conn_name) != NULL) {
	//do something with the current line (buff)
}



-OR-




fscanf(conn_name, "what to read", variable addresses);

--> just like scanf, with control strings
--> returns the number of variables correctly read (0 if none)
--> returns EOF if at end of file




/////////////////////////////////


3) Write to the file (just like printf)

fprintf(FILE* conn_name, char str[], variables to print...)







////////////////////////////////////

4) Close the file

fclose(conn_name);



///////////////////////////////////

Lab 3 - convert a file of dates to a different format

12/31/1999 to December 31, 1999

creating ONE string for the current output line

char line[100];     //this will hold the correct output for the line

use strcpy and strcat to put each piece into line


to get day (same for year):
    char day[10];
    sprintf(day, "%d", value of the day as an int);

--> now you can strcat day onto line


print line ONCE (per line in the file) to output file
